Scripts:

Scripts can be uploaded by file to start. We can also provide a name and also a description. Modal to upload

They are then copied over to the .tunnlr/scripts folder Then once they are uploaded they are available for selection in tunnel configurations.

The scripts page has a button that allows opening from file, then a table with script name, and description as well as script type.

name | desc | script type
Script 1 | This is a test script | sh

When we run a configuration, we allow the user to input arguments for each script (or use default arguments that they have set on a per tunnel-config basis).
